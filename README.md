# TOP-TRUMPS-A-TEAM
Team Projects
This Project was a theme project consisting of five collaborators working building a game.
I worked on the Online version of the game.
Pease look at the folder called Screenshots to view screen shots of the game alongside  a link to a video of the game played on the online versioon.
In addition to play the game follow this steps: 
Download the ITSD2018Template folder and import to eclipse.
OPEN CMD (Command Prompt)
NAVIFATE TO TARGET file directory
RUN "java -jar ITSD2018Template-1.0.jar -o"
OPEN BROWSER ( Preferably Google chrome / Firefox )
GOTO "http://localhost:7777/toptrumps/"
Play the Game.
